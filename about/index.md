Hey there, my name is Cristian Conache. 

I'm a computer science student at Univeristy of Bucharest, Romania.<br> Also, I'm assistant mentor on <a href="http://devacademy.ro/learning-programs/ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails track</a> in a verry cool NGO named <a href="http://devacademy.ro/">Devacademy</a>. It's an awesome organization full of beautiful, passionate and enthuziastic people focused on learning and innovation.

I'm really passionate about progamming and technology in general.
I like web development, but at the same time, I'm in an interesting process  trying to figure out what I like the most, because I frequently discover something new that makes me want to study and learn more about the new descovered thing.
So, stay tuned to see my journey!
